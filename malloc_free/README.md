- [0-create_array.c](https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/0-create_array.c) - creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char, Returns `NULL` if size = `0`, Returns a pointer to the array, or `NULL` if it fails<br/>
- [1-strdup.c](https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/1-strdup.c) - returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter, The `_strdup()` function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string `str`. Memory for the new string is obtained with `malloc`, and can be freed with `free`. Returns `NULL` if `str = NULL`, On success, the ``_strdup`` function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns `NULL` if insufficient memory was available<br/>
- [2-str_concat.c](https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/2-str_concat.c) - concatenates two strings, The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of `s1`, followed by the contents of `s2`, and null terminated, if `NULL` is passed, treat it as an empty string, The function should return `NULL` on failure<br/>
- [3-alloc_grid.c](https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c) - returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers, Each element of the grid should be initialized to `0`, The function should return `NULL` on failure, If `width` or `height` is `0` or negative, return `NULL`.<br/>
- [4-free_grid.c](https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/4-free_grid.c) - frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function, Note that we will compile with your `alloc_grid.c` file. Make sure it compiles.<br/>
