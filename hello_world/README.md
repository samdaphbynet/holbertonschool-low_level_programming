- [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/hello_world/0-preprocessor) - runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file `C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE`,`output should be saved in the file c`.<br/>
- [1-compiler](https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/hello_world/2-assembler) - script that compiles a C file but does not link`c file in the variable $CFILE`output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.<br/>
- [2-assembler](https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/hello_world/2-assembler) - generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file`c file in the variable $CFILE`,output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.<br/>
